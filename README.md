# Assignment 1

Memory Match
Create a game of memory match for 1 player. 20 cards (10 pairs) are shuffled and placed face
down. The user tries to find matching pairs by selecting two cards. If the pair match, they are
removed from the board. If they do not match, they are returned to their places face down. The
game ends when all pairs are matched, and the user should be told their score (number of turns
it took to complete the game).
